- [ ] Define a class called Rectangle with member variables length and width. Use appropriate member functions to calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
- [ ] Write a main function to create two rectangle objects and display its area and perimeter. Check whether the two Rectangles have the same area and print a message indicating the result.
- [ ] Write the definition for a class called Complex that has floating-point data members for storing real and imaginary parts. Define a function Complex sum(Complex) to add two complex numbers & return a complex number. Write the main function to create three complex number objects.
- [ ] Define a class called Time that has hours and minutes as integers. Write the definitions for each of the member functions. Write a main function to create three time objects. Set the value in two objects and call sum() to calculate the sum and assign it to the third object.
- [ ] Create a class ‘Account’ with two overloaded constructors. The first constructor is used for initializing the name of the account holder, the account number, and the initial amount in the account. The second constructor is used for initializing additional information.

## Cycle 3: Inheritance, method overloading and overriding, Polymorphism
- [ ] Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'print-Salary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class.
- [ ] Write two Java classes Employee and Engineer. Engineer should inherit from Employee class.
- [ ] Write a Java program to implement the level of inheritance.
- [ ] Write a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named numberOfSides().
- [ ] Write a program to represent geometric shapes and some operations that can be performed on them.
- [ ] Define an interface “Operations” which has methods area(), volume(). Create class a Cylinder which implements this interface.

## Cycle 4: Multithreading
- [ ] Write a Java program to create two threads for displaying odd and even numbers respectively.
- [ ] Write a Java program that sets thread priorities and display the priority.
- [ ] Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads.
- [ ] Write a program to illustrate creation of threads using the runnable interface.
- [ ] Write a Java program showing a typical invocation of banking operations via multiple threads.

## Cycle 5: Input-Output, File Management and exception handling
- [ ] Write a Java Program to merge data from two files into a third file.
- [ ] Write a Java Program to perform file merge operation where merging should be done by line by line alternatively.
- [ ] Write a Java program that reads a set of real numbers from a file and displays the minimum, maximum, average, and range of the numbers in the file.
- [ ] Write a program that reads the contents of a file and creates an exact copy of the file, except that each line is numbered.
- [ ] Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers.
- [ ] Write a Java program that displays the number of characters, lines, and words in a text file.
- [ ] Create a class Student with attributes roll no, name, age, and course. Handle exceptions for age not in the range 15-21.
- [ ] Write a Java program to define a class salesman with the attributes name, salesman code, sales amount, and commission. Generate and handle exceptions if sales amount is less than 0.

## Cycle 6: Networking
- [ ] Download the content of a file from the internet.
- [ ] Make a public chatting program using TCP/IP.
- [ ] Make a peer-to-peer messaging program using UDP.

## Cycle 7: Database Programming
- [ ] Construct the following tables: Department, Emp.
- [ ] Write a program for displaying information in the given order from the above tables.
- [ ] Program to implement database connectivity using object-oriented concepts.
- [ ] Write a JDBC program with Parametrized queries to update a given record in the Emp table.
- [ ] Write a JDBC program with Parametrized queries to list the records of Emp table whose names start with the alphabet “R”.
- [ ] Write a JDBC program with PreparedStatement to delete the records of Emp table whose salary is less than 10,000.
- [ ] Implement a JDBC program using a Stored Procedure to insert records into the Department table.
- [ ] Use Callable statement to implement a Stored Procedure to display the Ename and Salary of all employees.
- [ ] Write a JDBC program to implement Transaction Management in the Department table.
- [ ] Write a JDBC program to depict the usage of SQLException Class and SQLWarning Class.

## Cycle 8: Graphics Programming
- [ ] Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator.
- [ ] Write a Java program that simulates a traffic light.

## Cycle 9: Collection Framework
- [ ] Write a Java program to create a doubly linked list of elements.
- [ ] Write a Java program that implements Quick sort algorithm for sorting a list of names in ascending order.
